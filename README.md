# Overview
This MicroEJ project helps to configure and test the touch panel:
- Filtering: drag events must not be generated when a finger is pressed but not moving.
- Calibration: position of touch panel on the screen.
- Drag distribution: the drag events position must be regularly distributed when swiping.

It is useful to run this project to test the BSP touch panel driver and make sure the events sent to the Java MicroUI library are correct.
